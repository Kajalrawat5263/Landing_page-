# Landing_page-Creating a landing page for a recipe using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves several steps. Here's a simple example

### Images
You should have an image named `chocolate-cake.jpg` in the same directory as your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, or adjust the image path accordingly.

### File Structure
Your project structure should look something like this:
```
/your-project-directory
    ├── index.html
    ├── styles.css
    ├── script.js
    └── chocolate-cake.jpg
```

This simple example sets up a basic landing page for a chocolate cake recipe, including a header, navigation, hero image, ingredients, instructions, and a footer. You can expand on this by adding more styles, animations, and interactive elements as needed.
